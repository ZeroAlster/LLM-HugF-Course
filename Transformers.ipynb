Things that never change are - simply put - unimportant. It\\'s the reason you never \"see\" your nose or \"feel\" your tongue in your mouth (unless you consciously concentrate on it). It\\'s unimportant stimuli that doesn\\'t ever change. So, when your brain is receiving a constant signal from some constant source, it eventually tunes it out. It\\'s why you eventually stop smelling a bad smell (olfactory fatigue) and aren\\'t constantly feeling the clothes touching your body (again, unless you focus on it). But, this is actually bad for sight. Vision is pretty important and purely motion-based sight would be a serious flaw. To compensate, your eyes are constantly moving. Since your eyes are constantly moving (very slightly) your brain sees the images coming in as being slightly different each time which is interpreted as movement, so you are always (mostly) aware of everything you are looking at. I say mostly because it\\'s possible for large blotches of the same color to not register as moving even with the natural movement of your eyes. This is what is going on with this picture.

              " 'Your brain stops telling you that it is there. Basically, your brain is concerned about *changes* to your environment. New or changing stimuli. Things that never change are - simply put - unimportant. It\\'s the reason you never \"see\" your nose or \"feel\" your tongue in your mouth (unless you consciously concentrate on it). It\\'s unimportant stimuli that doesn\\'t ever change. So, when your brain is receiving a constant signal from some constant source, it eventually tunes it out. It\\'s why you eventually stop smelling a bad smell (olfactory fatigue) and aren\\'t constantly feeling the clothes touching your body (again, unless you focus on it). But, this is actually bad for sight. Vision is pretty important and purely motion-based sight would be a serious flaw. To compensate, your eyes are constantly moving. Since your eyes are constantly moving (very slightly) your brain sees the images coming in as being slightly different each time which is interpreted as movement, so you are always (mostly) aware of everything you are looking at. I say mostly because it\\'s possible for large blotches of the same color to not register as moving even with the natural movement of your eyes. This is what is going on with this picture. Your brain really doesn\\'t see it as moving, sees it as unimportant stimuli, so stops processing it.',\n",
